# Star Wars API

## Task

Iâ€™d like you to create an API which provides ordered information on various entities from the Star Wars films by their statistics.

For the purpose of this task, you will use [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/), a public Star Wars REST API.

Service should present an API which:

- Surfaces a list of starships sorted by name
- Allow the sort order to be ascending or descending
- Allow the sort key to be changed (e.g. sort by length or cost rather than name)

## Local dev

Create project specific environment for dependencies

    python3 -m venv .venv

Activate project libraries:

    source .venv/bin/activate

Install all project dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app

    uvicorn src.main:app --reload
